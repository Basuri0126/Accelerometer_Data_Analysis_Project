# Accelerometer Dataset Case Study

## Overview

This case study dives deep into an **accelerometer dataset** to explore human movement, activity recognition, and physical behavior analysis. Accelerometers are sensors widely used to measure and record acceleration forces, making this dataset highly valuable for studying **human motion** and **activity patterns**.

The dataset captures various **physical activities** performed by individuals while wearing accelerometer devices. It records acceleration data across multiple axes—**x**, **y**, and **z**—providing a detailed view of the forces experienced during different activities.
